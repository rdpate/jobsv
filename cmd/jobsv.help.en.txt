% CMD..

Create and monitor a pool of active job slots, which is available to executed CMD and children.  By default, an existing pool (inherited from a parent process) is re-used.

Note that the number of slots (option value N) can be specified, but it should seldom be needed!

Options:
    --new[=N]               create new pool with N initial slots
    --fixed[=N]             --new[=N] without monitoring
    --no-makeflags          don't modify/create $MAKEFLAGS
