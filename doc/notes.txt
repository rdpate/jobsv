* future ideas
    * jobsv-monitor may go away; it adds complication and detracts from the ultimately-desired interface
* notes
    * job slots are taken to mean "full use of one processor", except each jobserver believes it can use each processor fully
        * this means if any one jobserver is running, it will (attempt to) use each processor fully, and more than one running will simply share under the OS
    * "at most N workers" is treated as a simpler approximation of "parallelize to fully utilize processors"
    * processes which spawn multiple concurrent workers are rare
    * most commands should ignore Jobserver
        * because they don't spawn multiple concurrent workers and only "use" one processor
        * yet, children should have the same Jobserver instance available for use
    * some programs (eg. tmux) close all file descriptors, so any complete solution must allow at least one more mechanism
    * GNU Make 4.1 (and probably others) requires blocking FDs, as tested by:
        > mkfifo pipe
        > printf xx >>pipe &
        > exec 3<pipe 4>>pipe
        > export MAKE_FLAGS=' -j --jobserver-fds=3,4'
        > # Makefile contains 4 parallel "sleep 1" phony targets
        > time make
        > # set &3 non-blocking
        > time make
        > # make: *** read jobs pipe: Resource temporarily unavailable.  Stop.
    * blocking IO complicates shared file descriptors under contention
        * if read_fd is ready, as indicated by poll or select, then immediately after, it may still block indefinitely
