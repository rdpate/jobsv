Source jobsv.sh to use Jobserver in a shell script:

    if jobsv_sh="$(which jobsv.sh 2>/dev/null)"; then
        . "$jobsv_sh"
        jobsv_or_exec "$0" "$@"
    else
        jobsv_bg() { "$@"; }
        fi

Sourcing may set the exit trap.  If resetting this trap, ensure jobsv_exiting is executed.

jobsv_or_exec "$0" "$@"
    Ensure run under Jobserver, which might re-exec "$0" "$@".  (If not executable or originally run with a different interpreter or flags, then will not be the same!)

    Will print a warning if jobsv not in PATH, check jobsv_missing to avoid:
        $jobsv_missing || jobsv_or_exec "$0" "$@"

jobsv_bg CMD..
    Pass active slot to "CMD </dev/null &", then acquire another slot.

jobsv_bg_stdin CMD..
    As jobsv_bg, except stdin has already been redirected for CMD.

jobsv_sleeping CMD..
    Release active slot to run CMD, then reacquire (which might cheat).

jobsv_exiting
    Wait for children and ensure one slot is held when exiting (one slot was held when starting).  Only needed if resetting exit trap, from where it should be called.
